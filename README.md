This repository is for Crab Diffuser, an endless-runner game to pair with crab claw ALT-Controllers my team built in AET.

It includes the Unity project and game, as well as the scripts created by Nada Aburayyan.

This game was made by 3 Seniors as a project submission at UT Austin:

 (Alt control)

Alana (Character & Environment Artist)

Nada Aburayyan (Programmer & Scripter)

Each file is commented and explains what it does.

IMPORTANT TIPS:

You can utilize the SAVE and LOAD functions, located in the main and pause menus as well as at the bottom of the dialogue box. This will help you go back to important decisions to try out different paths (ex: saving once you reach the point of choosing whihc student to work with).
You can use the SKIP function, also located at the bottom of the dialogue box, to speed through parts of the story you've experienced before (such as the intro chapter).
