This repository is for Crab Diffuser, an endless-runner game to pair with crab claw ALT-Controllers my team built in AET.

It includes the Unity project and game, as well as the scripts created by Nada Aburayyan.

This game was made by 3 Seniors as a project submission at UT Austin:

The game is controlled by slipping on styrofoam crab claws and clacking the left claw to jump and the right to snip the wires.
